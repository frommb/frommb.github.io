        <p>Hickâ€™s law means you can design so that more users will visit and stay on your website. 
            Amazon does a great job at that. From the picture it is a very clean layout,
            that shows exactly what anyone would want as a product. It has multiple tabs to reference its quality of goods.
            As well as has a page dedicated to deals. Amazon demontrates Hick's Law very well.</p>

        <h1>Fitt's Law</h1>
        <h2>Google Inc</h2>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a><br></br>
        <img src="images/Google.png" alt="google">
        <p>Put simply, Fitts's Law states "the time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target" Google's main website does a great job at following Fitt's Law.
        They have condensed all of the information someone would need into a clean space for the purpose of getting someone somewhere else.
