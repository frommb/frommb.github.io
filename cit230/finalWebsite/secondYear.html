        <h1>Koblenz Germany</h1>
        <p>
         Koblenz is an ancient city in central Germany, 
        and a gateway to the terraced vineyards and ruined castles of the Rhine Gorge. 
        In the center, a monumental statue of William the Great marks the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle rivers.
        A cable car connects to the hilltop Ehrenbreitstein Fortress (a huge fortress), 
        which hosts museums and cultural events. 
        South along the river is the neo-Gothic Stolzenfels Castle with its gardens. Koblenz was my favorite area on my mission. I had two companion durring my time here.
        One companion I ended up serving with for 3 transfers! I loved this area and the Branch that I served in.
        It was also the most beutiful area in our mission. I was able to serve here for 6 months.

        <h1> Usingen Germany</h1>
          <p>
           Usingen is a small town in the Hochtaunuskreis in Hessen, Germany. 
        Until 1972, this residential and school town was the seat of the former district of Usingen. Usingen was the last area that i served in.
        I was called as a district leader my first two transfers there and then became a trainer on top of being district leader. Even though Usingen was my last area,
        I was able to truly impact not only the members but also the missionaries in my district.
        I was able to teach alot of great German people there and I believe this is where i truly masterd the German language, and also how to speak english thanks to my trainie.
