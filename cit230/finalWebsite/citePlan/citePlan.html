      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to create a website based off of where I served my mission. 
        The homepage would go over what mission I served in, and give a brief overview of which areas I served in. 
        It would then link to 4 other pages each one about the four areas I served in. 
        They would all have detailed pictures and details about what made each area so special. 
        This was an idea that my family gave me and they said it would be beneficial for everyone.
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will mostly be my family and friends I served with on my mission. It also serves as a scrapbook for my children.</p>

      <p>
        [I chose Merriweather because most of my audiance will be older than 50 at this point in time.
        So to make it easier for them to read I went through many fonts and they liked this one the most.]        </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: [Noto Sans]  
      </h4>
      <p>
        [My reasoning for the paragraph font is the same as my heading font.
        It is an easliy read font for people of all ages and simply looks like a clean font.]

         The official language of Germany is German. Besides ethnic Germans, 
        there are many migrant groups present in the country, such as Turks and Poles. 
        Germany has become an increasingly irreligious country, 
        especially in the eastern portion of the country that was once part of the Soviet Union. 
        About half of Germany’s population identifies itself as Christian, 
        this population is primarily split between the Roman Catholic church and various Protestant denominations. 
        Germany has a rich history of classical composers, writers, and philosophers. 
        In modern times, rock, hip hop, metal, and electronic music are all quite popular, 
        with both German and international artists receiving radio play. 
        Other aspects of German culture and history are preserved in museums and theater. 
        Soccer is Germany’s most popular sport, with the national team having won the World Cup three times. Euskirchen is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

      My first area was Euskirchen.
        While Euskirchen resembles a modern shopping town, 
        it also has a history dating back over 700 years, having been granted town status in 1302.
        Parts of the ancient town wall, and three of its defensive towers, are still standing. 
        Tourists are also attracted to Euskirchen due to the proximity of two large cities, 
        Cologne and Bonn, to the northeast, and the hills of the Eifel region to the south. 
        Euskirchen was my first area on my mission. It was a small area that required the use of bikes and public transportation. 
        I had three companions in this area, and served here for about 7 months or 5 transfers.

        Essen is the central and second largest city of the Ruhr, the largest urban area in Germany.
        Its population of 583,393 makes it the ninth largest city of Germany, 
        as well as the fourth largest city of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Essen was the largest City in my mission.
        It was also the area that I had the most succsess with baptisms. I was here for 6 months or 4 transfers.

        Koblenz is an ancient city in central Germany, 
        and a gateway to the terraced vineyards and ruined castles of the Rhine Gorge. 
        In the center, a monumental statue of William the Great marks the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle rivers.
        A cable car connects to the hilltop Ehrenbreitstein Fortress, 
        which hosts museums and cultural events. 
        South along the river is the neo-Gothic Stolzenfels Castle with its gardens. Koblenz was my favorite area on my mission.
        It was also the most beutiful area in our mission. I was able to serve here for 6 months or 4 transfers.

        Usingen is a small town in the Hochtaunuskreis in Hessen, Germany. 
        Until 1972, this residential and school town was the seat of the former district of Usingen. Usingen was the last area that i served in.
        I was called as a district leader my first two transfers there and then became a trainer on top of being district leader.
        I was able to teach alot of great German people there and this is where i truly masterd the German language.
